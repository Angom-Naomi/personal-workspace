<p>Hi there! My name is Angom Naomi Deborah, a software developer born and raised in Uganda. <br> For a brief intro into my coding journey; I first met code in my year 1 at the university and I did not like it. Everything about it looked strange and complicated. I tried my best to understand it for one simple reason that every student gives, "cram to pass the exam then count it done". <br>However, as the semesters passed by, I realized that I actually wanted to learn code. I had grown fond of it, found it intriguing, and I was curious to know more. Supplemented by a few more coding workshops and trainings, here I am.</p>
<p>I have used technologies like JavaScript, C#, HTML and CSS, Java, and Visual basic. I am also familiar with tools like VSCode (code editor), Git and Github (for version control), Trello and Pivotal tracker (for project management), and Node.js.<br>I have worked on both personal and group projects building websites and mobile apps. </p><p>For any aspiring software developer out there, don't give up. You won't know how far you can go unless you persist. Discover your potential and fly beyond the limits.</p>
